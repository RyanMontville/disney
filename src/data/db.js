We got to walk through the utilidoors, the tunnel system at the Magic Kingdom. Most people who know about the tunnels assume they are underground, but the tunnels are actually at ground level and the Magic Kingdom is on the second story. It was cool to see behind the scenes of Disney and how the Magic Kingdom operates. Soon I will be walking through the utilidoors to go to work each day at Columbia Harbor House.

Wednesday we went back to Hollywood studios to ride some of the other rides.\n Thursday was my first shift at Columbia Harbor House. I was on dining room the entire shift, which means taking out the trash, cleaning off the tables, sweeping the floors, and taking the trays to the back. Thursday was slow because it rained most of the day. The shift went well and I almost got out on time. There was a new group of college program trainees who were working dining room with me, so it took longer then normal. Friday I was on counter, greeter, and dining room. It was nice to rotate different positions instead of being in the same spot all day long. Friday was a lot busier than Thursday, which meant I always had something to do and I was never bored. I started on counter, then went to greeter, then to dining room until close. Saturday was another busy day.

The Hall of Presidents has one of the three presidential seal in the country, which gets cleaned periodically by White House staff members.

Cast members have the opportunity to pick up open shifts at other locations and one of the shifts available to work is the parades. The main responsibilities of PAC shifts include directing guests, keeping the walkways clear, and telling guest where the can and cannot go. I clocked in a 7pm backstage and was assigned to a captain along with four other cast members. We where assigned to the garden walkway in the newly expanded hub area in front of the castle. Our job included keeping guest inside of the parade/firework viewing area, keeping the walkway clear and make sure that the flow of guest keeps going the right way. Our walkway was a one-way walkway which had an intersection which lead to a shortcut to the main entrance that bypasses Main Street. I worked from 7-10:45pm through the first Electrical Parade, Celebrate the Magic, and Wishes. Tonight had cool weather and the park was not too crowded, which made the night stress-free and enjoyable. I will definitely try to pick up more PAC shifts in the future.\nOther things that have happened recently:\n- I went to a resume writing course that the Disney College Program offers. In the course I learned what Disney recruiters are looking for in a resume and how to improve my chances of getting noticed by Disney recruiters.\n- We got new carpet last week, it is a bit better than the old carpet.\n- My roommates and I conquered the mountains (Space Mountain, Splash Mountain, and Big Thunder Mountain) in the same day.",

I will post more about the cruise once we get back on May 1.\nA lot has happened since I posted last and I have been very busy. March 29 through April 11 was spring break for most schools, which meant it was peek season for Disney World. Columbia Harbor House opened an hour earlier and closed and hour later than normal. I worked a total of 117 those two week, making it the most hours I have worked yet, and two of the largest pay checks I have gotten from Disney. Last week I was trained on register, which was two days of training. I enjoy being on the register, it might even be my favorite position at the Harbor House.\nAfter 100 days in the Disney College Program, I am still loving it here in Orlando. While my job might not be fun or enjoyable 100% of the time, the memories I get to make for the guests and the adventures I have on my days off always make up for it. Everything about the program is perfect. I get along with my roommates all the time, our apartment is great, the weather is Florida is amazing, and being able to go to the parks whenever I want still hasn't gotten old.\nWorking for Disney has not ruined the magic for me. Working here, being able to see how Disney operates and makes the magic for all of the guests that visit the parks each day, has only made me love Disney more. Watching the parades and shows are still as fun as the first time I saw them. I am still learning new facts about Disney and trying new things everyday.\nThere are many days left until July 30 when my program ends and hopefully many more adventures left as well.",

My favorite of the shows was Toy Story the musical, which was a musical adaptation of the first movie. It had all of the characters, most of which you don't see in the parks.\nThe first stop was Cozumel. We decided to go to Chankanaab national park. We swam with the dolphins, swam in the ocean, watched a sea lion show, and relaxed on the beach. That night's show was Kyle & Mistie Knight's magic show, which was really cool. The next night they performed in the adult only lounge and I was chosen to be part of the show. Mistie did a quick change trick where she was tied up, then 30 seconds later was wearing my jacket. It was a lot of fun being part of the show. The next trick my roommates went up. Seven people were given envelopes, then an eighth person picked a random number from a phone book, then it was revealed that the envelopes had the numbers in the phone number, in the correct order.\nThe last day of the cruise we went to Disney's private island in the Bahamas, Castaway Cay. We did the Castaway 5k in the morning, the hung out on the beach for the rest of the day. The cruise had a midnight showing of the Avengers 2 that night.",

My horse, cooper, was awesome and made the ride a lot of fun. We went to go eat at Trails End afterwards, which was delicious. After Trails End we went to Magic Kingdom. We got birthday buttons, stopped by work, rode Haunted Mansion, went to the Laugh Floor, and hung out for a while. It started raining so all of the night show were cancelled, but we still had fun in the rain. We hung out in the Main Street shops for a bit before heading home. This was definitely one the best birthdays I have ever had, and I'm glad I got to spend it in Disney World with my Friends.\nOther stuff that has happened since my last post:\n- Alex did not extend with us, so his program ended on May 15.\n- Magic Kingdom was open for 24 hours to kick off Disney's coolest summer ever. Columbia Harbor House was open until 2 am and I worked until 3 am. It was fun working later than normal. We were not too busy, the guest were all very nice, and closing went by quickly.\n- I went kayaking with some of my friends at Shingle Creek.\n- Magic Kingdom was rented out by IPW, an international travel company. The park closed a 6 pm to guest. We were the only location to stay open and serve our normal menu during the event. A few other locations had buffets.\n- Star Wars weekends happened at Hollywood Studios. The Backlots tour, which recently shut down, turned into Darth's Mall, which consisted of two stores filled with Star War's merchandise. There were also character meet and greets. I had the chance to meet some clone troopers, chewbacca, and Chip and Dale as ewoks.\n- My family came down to visit for a second time.",

The magic of Disney has not been ruined for me, learning how Disney works and getting to make the guests happy has only made me love Disney more.\nMy siblings flew down on the 28. We did all four parks in one day on the 29. We started at Animal Kingdom, then over to Hollywood Studios, then to Epcot, and ended in Magic Kingdom and stayed until park close at 1 am. We spent the night at the Animal Kingdom Lodge and then started the 2 day drive back to Ohio the next morning.\nEven though my program is over, this is not goodbye to Disney, just see ya real soon. I go back to school for my final year in August, and hope to graduate in May and go back to Disney for a professional internship. I will continue to update this blog every once in a while when new things happen. Thanks for reading!",

On Thursday we went to Splitsville and walked around Disney Springs as well. On Friday we went to Mickey's not so scary Halloween party. The party didn't start until 7 pm, but the ticket allows you to get into Magic Kingdom at 4 pm. The Halloween parties are one of the few times where you can wear costumes to Disney World. I went as Mrs. Nesbitt. We rode a few ride, then had dinner at Be Our Guest, which was my first time eating there. Once the party started, we focused more on the party exclusive things rather than riding rides, since we can ride them whenever we want. We got to meet Lotso, which you can only meet during special events, which was really fun. We went and watched the new Hocus Pocus Villain Spelltacular, which was one of the best show Disney has ever produced. We stayed and watched Celebrate the magic and Hallowishes. We walked around and checked out all of the decorations throughout the park while we waited for the Boo To You parade. Boo to You is my new favorite nighttime entertainment at Disney World. After the parade we rode Big Thunder Mountain, then trick-or-treated throughout the park until park close.\nThe rest of my family flew in on Saturday and we stayed at the Tree House Villas for the rest of our vacation. We went to Disney Springs Saturday night. Sunday we went to Universal Studios and I went to the Halloween party again with my family. My parents dressed as Fear and Joy from Inside out. My sister went as Anger, my brothers went as Christopher Robin and Dipper from Gravity Falls, and my grandpa went as grown up Russell from Up. We went on rides, saw the show, and got to listen to the Cadaver Dans, the undead Dapper Dans. On Monday we went to Epcot in the morning and checked out the Food and Wine festival. My favorite time to go to Epcot is during the festivals because there is so much more to do throughout the world showcase and the rest of the park. We then park hopped over to the Magic Kingdom for the rest of the day. We rode the rides we didn't ride the day before and then watched Wishes and the Main Street Electric Light parade. My sister and I flew back to Columbus on Tuesday because we had to go back to school. I already have my next trip planned for January before the spring semester starts.",

    "body": "My second Disney College Program has started and I am all done with training at my new location at Hollywood Studios. I'm working in Hollywood Hills which includes Rock 'n' Roller Coaster, Tower of Terror, and Fantasmic. The first 2 weeks of program similar to my last program: checking in, Traditions, a few classes at Disney University. The Hollywood Studios orientation was a lot of fun. I enjoy learning about the history and stories of the parks and Hollywood Studios has a lot of awesome stories. Tower if Terror is one of my favorite rides and learning more about the story of the ride was really cool. I also learned that Tower and Coaster share some history. The Hollywood Tower hotel opened in 1917. G-Force Records opened in the 1920s. G-Force Records used the Hollywood Tower Hotel as a place for the artists and bands to stay when they were in town recording in the studios until lighting stuck the hotel on October 31, 1939. When Disney was building Walt Disney World, they purchased the Hollywood Tower Hotel for guest to stay at, but when they unlocked the doors, the bellhops appeared along with the rest of the hotel staff. Plans to reopen the hotel for guests to stay was scrapped.\nTraining at Coaster, Tower, and Fantasmic went well and went by quickly. I already had register experience from my last program at Columbia Harbour House. The costumes for my locations are nice and more comfortable than the Columbia Harbor House costume. I am really enjoying working in Hollywood Hills and right now my favorite location to work is at Fantasmic, although I have not yet worked a shift at Tower after training. Working merchandise is a lot of fun because part of the role is pin trading with guests or mechantaining the products such as having lightsaber duels with the guests.",

The Outpost Shop is the shop and cart outside of Animal Kingdoms main entrance. The cart and shop are by the tram stop and the bus stop, so all of the guests going to Animal Kingdom pass by the shop before entering the park. The Outpost shop is small compared to Coaster or Tower, but I really liked the layout of the shop with the registers in the center of the shop and all of the merchandise surrounding it. Most of the purchases guests made at the shop and cart were hats, sunglasses, and bottles of water. Even though it was a slow day compared to working at Hollywood Hills, it was still a really enjoyable shift.

Tomorrowland is probably my favorite land in the Magic Kingdom, so getting to work there was a lot of fun. I spent most of the shift in the Space Mountain gift shop. One thing that Space Mountain has that we don't have at Hollywood Studios is D-Tech on Demand, where you can personalize phone cases and MagicBands. I learned how the whole process works and how to ring up guests after they have created their customized cases or bands. Another thing we don't have at Hollywood Studios is PinQuest, which is a scavenger hunt at Magic Kingdom where you can purchase clues to find pins throughout the park. Space Mountain was one of the locations of PinQuest and I was able to be apart of PinQuest by selling guests the clues and giving them the pins if they found the correct answer.\nI also worked at Ursa's Major Minor Mart, which is the pin cart in front of Space Mountain, which is also near the Incredible's Super Dance Party. It was nice to hear a different set of songs besides the 14 Aerosmith songs on repeat or the same Disney covers that play every night at Fantasmic. Ursa's cart is very similar to the cart in the Rock 'n' Roller Coaster courtyard. It has trading pins, sunglasses and a glow cart. It was slow at Ursa's, but I got to enjoy Tomorrowland and the Incredible's dance party, so it was still enjoyable.",

It was a lot to take in compared to Coaster's and Tower's gift shops. At Coaster and Tower we have 3 gift registers and 2-3 photo registers while the Emporium has 35 registers.\nOn Friday I worked in the Mickey/Minnie room and the infants section. Working in the Mickey/Minnie room was really fun because the Emporium had already put out the Halloween merchandise in that room. While you don't have to buy merchandise items from the room they are from, most guest purchase the items near where they got them from. The Mickey/Minnie room is almost in the middle of the Emporium, so there was a fairly wide variety of the merchandise purchased. I the moved to the infants section, which is at the end of the Emporium next to Casey's Corner, making it the slowest register in the Emporium. Almost all of the guest that I rung up in the infants section were only purchasing infant merchandise. Most guests just passed through the infants section, especially after Wishes and the Main Street Electrical Parade because cast members direct them through the Emporium to reduce the crowds on Main Street. There is also a strong smell of ketchup in the infants section from Casey's, which I did not enjoy. I eventually went back to the Mickey/Minnie room and stayed there until the end of my shift. It never got too busy at any of the registers I worked at on Thursday, which made for a great first shift at the Emporium.\nOn Saturday my first assignment was the infants section. The start of my shift was even slower than Friday's shift, and I did not ring up many guests. I was then moved to the toys/plush section, which was much faster pace than the infants section. The toys/plush section is next the Mickey/Minnie room, so there was a wide range of items purchased, just like the registers in the Mickey/Minnie room. I was able to listen to the Main Street Electrical Parade while working in the toys/plush section and was even able to see parts of the floats through the doorways, which was awesome because I love the Electrical Parade and its soundtrack.My final assignment was the home decor section. Working in the home decor section was almost nothing but ringing up and wrapping mugs. It was also the busiest register I worked at the Emporium. After Wishes there was almost always a constant line at my register for the rest of the night. The home decor register was busier than any register at Coaster or Tower. Sometimes Fantasmic can be as busy, but only for about 5-10 minutes right before the show starts. The home decor register was busy all night.\nI enjoyed working at the Emporium a lot and will definitely be picking up more shifts there, maybe even on a Mickey's Not So Scary Halloween Party night. The Emporium is probably my favorite costume to wear because the costume actually fits me unlike Coaster or Fantasmic's costume.",

I got completely lost on my way to Tatooine Traders, and had to ask multiple people which way to go. I like my side of the park better. When I finally found where to go and clocked in, the first position I was given was the droid factory, where you can build your own droid. My job was to make sure the station was neat and organized and had enough parts. I also helped guests with any questions they had and even helped them dig though all the parts to find a specific colored piece.\nThere are two sets of registers in the store. The registers on the left side are called the Jawa registers and the ones on the right side are called the Death Star registers. I first worked on the Jawa registers, which have all of the expensive signed photos, jewelry, and collectibles. I then went to the Death Star registers which are beside the build your own lighsaber station. I did not have many transaction on either register.\nI was able to work at the build your own lightsaber station for a little bit, which was a ton of fun. I helped the guests decide which lightsaber they wanted to build and started the saber for them by assembling the color saber they want and the hilt they wanted. After that, they moved down the line where they could pick out which covers and slides they wanted on the saber.\nThe one part of working in Tatooine that I did not like was that the layout of the store is so compact and has so litle room for guests, that it was always very packed in the shop, and most people just followed the flow of people from the exit of the ride through the shop to leave. Overall it was fun working at a new location and new ways to interact with the guests.",

Mouse Gears was very busy because Mickey's Not So Scary was happening at Magic Kingdom, so guests who did not have a party ticket came over to Epcot. Food and Wine was also happening, which draws large crowds. It also rained most of the night, which caused guest to seek shelter in the shop. Once I was assigned to a register, then night went by faster and it was enjoyable. There was almost always a line at all of the registers. The shift I picked up was a closing shift, so once Mouse Gears closed, I helped with putbacks and stocking and making everything neat and organized. It was very interesting working at Epcot, backstage is completely different than Studios or Magic Kingdom. I'm not sure if I will pick up any more shifts in Epcot. My next goal is to work in every land of the Magic Kingdom. I have already worked Liberty Square, New Fantasyland/Storybook Circus, and Main Street.",

The parade had 2 performances, 9pm and 11pm. I stayed to watch both, then followed the parade along the parade route until the end. The sides of the streets were packed with guests watching the parade at both 9pm and 11pm and the crowd following the last float till the end was massive. It was a very sad to watch the final performance, but it was fun following it along the route, clapping along with the other guests and singing the end of the song every time it finished. The Electrical Parade is now making its way over to Disneyland to say goodbye, which leaves Magic Kingdom without a nighttime parade for now.",

The shop was a bit slow that day because Dinosaur was still down for refurbishment so less guests were in Dinoland, and guests were not exiting the ride through the gift shop. I went back and forth from register to greeting guests in the shop and pin trading. Dinoland has several outdoor carts and I worked two of them. The first cart was the Nemo cart over by the exit of Finding Nemo the Musical. Every 45 minutes, the theater would empty and the Nemo cart would get busy for a few minutes, then it would die down. The other cart I worked was the cart by the entrance of Dinoland. I didn't really sell anything or interact with many guests, but I was only out at the cart 5 minutes before I clocked out. The cart was one of the Wilderness Explorer stops, so it was fun to help kids with the Wilderness Explorers badge. For the badge at the Dino cart, wilderness Explorers had to find three signal flags near the entrance of Dinoland, but since I was only at the cart for about 5 minutes, I was only able to help one family with the Wildernss Explorer badge. Its always fun working in Animal Kingdom, it just seems completely different from the shops at the other parks.",

    "badge": require('../images/badges/mnsshp.png'),
    "body": "Mickey's Not So Scary Halloween party is my favorite thing to do at Disney World. I went to the party as a guest the second week of September. This year I also had the opportunity to pick up shifts in Magic Kingdom during the parties.\nThe first Halloween party shift I picked up was at the Emporium. The Emporium was slower than usual because less tickets are sold for the parties than normal days and because most of the guests were outside enjoying all of the party exclusive offerings throughout the park. I started my shift in the Star Wars/Pixar/snacks section. We also had one of the party exclusive trading pins and the Halloween ornaments. Working in this section was really fun and enjoyable because there was Halloween music playing in the first few sections of the Emporium. I then went to the Princess section, which was playing the Kidz Bop Halloween album all night. The Princess section is one of the slower sections of the Emporium, but I was able to listen to the Boo TO You parade and the Happy Hallowishes fireworks, which are both amazing. My last position of the night was in the Mickey/Minnie section, which is where most of the Halloween merchandise is. We also had the annual passholder exclusive shirt a the register. I ended up picking up 2 more party shifts at the Emporium that went about the same a the first shift.\nThe second Halloween party shift I picked up was a treats shift. The location I picked up was in Pete's Silly Side Show in Storybook Circus. Picking up a treats shift is very difficult because most of them are given to attraction cast members and then some are post for cast members looking for extra hours around 3 am on Sunday. I was able to pick up the shift from a cast member on Facebook. I had never worked in Storybook Circus before, so it was funny to work a candy shift there before working a merchandise shift. The treats shift was so much fun, probably one of my favorite shifts I have worked. Handing out candy to guests for 6 hours, the phrase \"Happy Halloween\" started to sound like nonsense words after saying it to every guest who comes through the candy line. On my break I was able to watch Hallowishes from behind Pete's Silly Sideshow, which is an amazing view of the fireworks. My favorite moment of the night was when a group of guests came in with there service dogs who were dressed up in costumes and trick or treating for their owners. They held the treat bags in there mouth and walked up to us to get the candy. It was the cutest and most amazing thing I have ever seen working for Disney.\nI also picked up a couple of shifts at Big Top Souvenirs. Big Top is a popular shop during the Halloween parties because the treat location at Pete's Silly sideshow exits into Big Top, and it is also the only shop that has all of the party exclusive pins. The first shift I picked up at Big Top I was on the same register all night because it was the only register that didn't need special training. On party night, there are too many cast members working in Big Top, so I was often put on games to entertain the guests such as ring toss or “pin the boo on the ghost”. I also helped handed out samples from the candy counter.\nI traded one of my Fantasmic shifts for a glow cart shift in Magic Kingdom. My cart was in Liberty Square right on the corner of the parade route. Magic Kingdom's glow carts are several times larger than the glow carts we have at Fantasmic. For example we only take 10 sorcerer glow swords at Fantasmic, Magic kingdom takes 50 swords; we take 24 bubbles (12 Ariel bubbles and 12 blue bubbles), Magic Kingdom takes 24 of each. At Fantasmic we recently got tablets for all the carts which has doubled our sales; Magic Kingdom does not yet have tablets, but yet still makes more money per cart than we do with tablets. The glow shifts at Magic Kingdom are also longer than Fantasmic shifts. Working the glow cart during the party was so much fun. I got to listen to Haunted Mansion music all night long, got to see tons of awesome costumes, was able to watch Boo-to-You and Hallowishes, and got to wear the Halloween costume.\nAnother location I worked on a party night was the Pirates gift shop. It was slow during the party since most guests are not riding rides and mostly go to Emporium or Circus for the Halloween party merchandise, so I was greeting guests as they came off of the ride more than being on a register. It was a fun location to work. I got to listen to the Pirates music before the party started, then once the party started Adventureland played adventure-themed rock music such as Rock You Like a Hurricane or Message in a Bottle. Since the Pirates gift shop is very open, almost an outdoor location, I was able to watch Hallowishes. I had picked up a closing shift, so after the ride was clear of guests I help straighten and restock the shop.\nHurricane Mathew forced Disney to cancel 2 Halloween parties. I had picked up shifts for both parties that were canceled. One of the shifts was Frontierland, which I had never worked before, so I was very disappointed when I did not get to work the shift. Luckily I was able to find another party shift in Frontierland before Halloween was over. I worked the Trading post and Big Als, the outdoor cart. I love pin trading, so working at the Trading Post was a ton of fun. It was slow during the party, but that gave me a chance to really interact with the guests and do a lot of pin trading. I was assigned to Big Als about an hour before the first parade. I got to listen to the Cadaver Dans, the undead cowboy barbershop quartet. I was able to watch Boo-to-You from the cart which was an amazing view. I was moved back into the Trading Post, but since it was a slow night I was also able to watch Hallowishes from the door.\nI ended the Halloween season with another treats shift at Pete's Silly sideshow. This shift was even more fun and enjoyable than the last treats shift. I was able to watch Hallowishes for the last time of the year. The costumes on Halloween were some of the best costumes I have seen this year. One guest was carrying an Eggo waffles box which confused me at first, but then I realized she was Eleven from the show Stranger Things. There were a few groups of guests dressed as the stretching portrait characters from the Haunted Mansion. My favorite costume of the night was a guest dressed as Hank from Finding Dory and was carrying a coffee pot with Dory swimming in it. Since it was the last Halloween Party, we were encouraged to give generous amounts of candy to the guests to get rid of it all. We ended up pre-filling candy bags and handing them to the guests, filling every bag they had, even filling popcorn buckets/backpacks/merchandise bags. After midnight, we jokingly wished the guests a Merry Christmas since the Halloween season at Disney had ended and they parks were already switching decorations over to Christmas that night after park clear.",

    "body": "After working in all 4 parks, I wanted to pick up shifts in Disney Springs. The first location I picked up was World of Disney, one of the largest Disney stores in the world. I thought since I enjoyed working at the Emporium that working at World of Disney would be about the same experience. I was wrong. World of Disney is so much busier than Emporium. I was on register all night long and the line of guests did not stop until after the store closed. I was in the Enchanted Dinning Room, a bank of registers that have the themeing of the dinning room from Beauty and the Beast, all night long. After we closed I helped straighten the plush toys in one of the largest plush toy sections of any Disney store. Working at World of Disney was stressful but interesting and I probably will not be picking up there again.\nI also picked up at the Christmas shop, Disney Day's of Christmas. This shift was not a busy as World of Disney, but was still very busy. I always get stressed when ringing up and wrapping fragile items, so ring up fragile ornaments all night long was not the most enjoyable shift, especially when the guests buys 7 ornaments and you have to wrap them all and try not to let the line of guest get too long. I enjoyed the Christmas shop more than World of Disney though. Listening to Christmas music all night was enjoyable and the night went pretty smooth once I got used to wrapping all the ornaments. I was on register all night long and clocked out before the store closed, so I never was tasking or restocking. This is another location that I will probably not be picking up at again.\nAnother shop I picked up was at the Star Wars Galactic Outpost over on the other side of Disney Springs. It was a pretty slow night, but it was a lot of fun. I got to merchantain the $170 lightsabers, help guests with the build-your-own lightsabers, and look at all the cool Star Wars artwork that is sold in the store. One unusual thing about the Star Wars Galactic Outpost is that their break room is Located on the second floor of Disney Quest, which is several buildings away and the only way to get from the Star Wars shop to the Disney Quest break room is onstage. I found out that we were able to just take off our name tag and just go to anywhere in Disney Springs, like to Starbucks which is just across from the Star Wars shop, but I already had all of my stuff in the Disney Quest break room, so I just went there.\nThe next week I picked up next door at the Superhero Headquarters. This was probably my favorite shop to work in Disney Springs. It is one of the smallest shops in Disney Springs, and the night was pretty slow, but I got to interact with the guests all night and merchantain Thor's hammer and Baby Groot. The other cast members working that night were awesome and we all had a lot of fun. I was able to watch the new Christmas drone show, which is really cool. My favorite guest interaction of the night was a guest who bought a vinylmation, opened it at the register, and when it wasn't the one he wanted, immediately bought another one and told the other cast member at the register that she couldn't look because she was bad luck. The second one he bought wasn't much better, so he went and bought a third one from a different set. While the guest didn't get any of the ones he wanted, he was still in a good mood when he left, and everyone working was also in a great mode from the interesting interaction. This time I didn;t bring anything with me so I didn't have to use the break room in Disney Quest and just went to Starbucks during my break, which was quite enjoyable. After the store closed, we didn't have much to do since the store was so slow that we straightened and restocked the store all night, so it was practically perfect when we closed. I want to pick up more shifts here again, but I don't have that much time before my program ends on January 5th, so I'm not sure if I will get a chance to work here again.",

    "body": "After working many Halloween party shifts and enjoying them, I knew I wanted to work during Mickey's Very Merry Christmas Party.\nThe first Christmas party shift I picked up was a wristband distribution shift at the park entrance. The shift was very easy and very enjoyable. The Christmas parties start at 7pm, but guests going to the party can enter the park at 4pm. The entrance is split into two: guests going to the party and normal day guests. As the party guests entered, I put a wristband on their wrist and wished them a Merry Christmas or told them to enjoy the party or some other greeting. I did that for 4 hours, that was the only thing I did the entire night. Even though it was extremely repettitive, it was still enjoyable because all of the cast members and all the guests were cheerful. I got to listen to Christmas music the entire shift and never ran into a problem or uncomfortable moment. The shift was only four hours long and I had time after the shift to go over to Disney Springs to watch Doctor Strange. I wanted to pick up another wristband shift, but was unable to find another shift.\nWorking towards my goal of working in as many shops I can, I picked up my first shift in Fantasyland. I worked in zone 2 which includes Fantasy Faire, the gift shop for Mickey's PhilharMagic, Sir Mickey's, which is the gift shop for the Princess Fairytale Hall. It was a very slow night, which most shops are slow during the parties, but this was probably one of the slowest shift I have worked. One thing I look forwards to when working the parties is the music in the shops switch over to holiday music once the parties start, but Fantasyland did not, which was disappointing. I only had a handful of transactions for the night and was mostly standing by waiting for guests to enter the shops. The shops were already stocked and organized since so few guest where there, so there was little to do.\nAnother new location I picked up during a party was Main Street East zone 3, which is the shop on the opposite site of Main Street from the Emporium. The first shop I was assigned to was Curtain Call Collectibles, which is the gift shop for Mickey's and Tinkerbell's Meet and Greet. It was slow, but the themeing in the shop is based around backstage of a Magician show which was really cool to look at all of the props and displays. The shops in Main Street zone three did not switch over to holiday music either, but the music wasn't bad. Another shop I worked in zone three was The Chapeau, which has a large selection of ears, bows, and other Disney hats. Guest can also get the hats embroidered there. The Chapeau has a great view of Main Street and I was able to watch the Christmas parade, which was cool.  I also worked at one of the outdoor carts near the train station. I mostly sold Mickey Santa hats and bulb necklaces as guests entered the park. One awesome thing about Main Street during the holidays is that Disney makes it snow, which was fun working in the snow without having to be freezing cold.\nI picked up a shift at the Emporium, which is still one of my favorite shops to work. Working in the Emporium during the holidays is fun because there is a ton of Christmas ordainment and merchandise. There wasn't really much else different than any of the other shifts I picked up at the Emporium. After we closed I helped put away the Christmas Party exclusive merchandise and put the regular merchandise back out, which I had never done before and was interesting.\nI picked up 2 shifts in Tomorrowland as was able to work in both zone 1 and zone 2. Tomorrowland plays TSO, Mannheim Steamroller, and other rock Christmas music during the parties, which is a fun change from the generic Christmas music that plays in all of the parks. Zone 1 is a lot slower than zone 2, mainly because no of the shop are attraction gift shops. I worked in the Buzz Lightyear gift shop for the first time, which was fun but very slow since the shop is so small most guests just walk through to the exit.\nI was able to pick up a glow shift during one of the last Christmas parties which was my favorite Christmas party shift. My glow cart was located in Fronteirland, so I got to listen to country Christmas music once the party started. I got to wear the Christmas costume again, which was fun, and I had fun the entire shift. I was able to watch the Christmas parade again and had the best view of any shift I have worked.\nUnlike the Halloween parties, there was not a Christmas party on Christmas, so I ended up working at Tower of Terror on Christmas. I only worked 8 Christmas parties and did not get to see parade/fireworks as much as I did during Halloween parties. I like the Halloween parties better, both as a guest and as a cast member, but the Christmas parties were still fun.",

    "body": "I finally was able to pick up a shift at Memento Mori, Haunted Mansions gift shop. It is very difficult to find shifts at Memento Mori and whenever a shift was posted before, I was unable to pick it up because I was already working somewhere else, but last week I finally found one I could work. When I went to pick up the costume, I found out it was next to the Haunted Mansion attractions costume and when I clocked in I found out I was wearing the attractions shirt instead of the merchandise shirt. Luckily they are similar enough that it didn't matter that I was wearing the wrong shirt, but I felt weird the entire shift knowing I had the wrong shirt on.\nMemento Mori is a smaller shop with not too much merchandise inside, so the shop was never really busy. There would always be guests inside the shop, but not many transactions and it was never packed. The shop only has three registers, so they don't need many cast members working the shop. One unique thing that Memento Mori has is a photo booth that can turn you into a ghost, with a photo that changes from your mortal state to ghost and back. The photo process is done by photopass cast members, but we take care of the transactions and giving the photos to the guest. Whenever a photo is ready, a bell rings to let you know that the photo has materialized inside of the photo cabinet which we then unlock for the guests. It was fun unlocking the cabinet to give the guests their ghost photos. Since it was Christmas week, the Christmas parade and fireworks were performed daily. I got to see the parade from afar and was able to listen to the Christmas fireworks one last time. Overall it was a fun location to work and I'm glad that I got to work at Memento Mori before my college program ended.",

Wishes was probably my favorite nighttime show at Disney World and got to watch/listen to Wishes during my first college program at Colombia Harbour House. I will miss Wishes and I hope the new fireworks show, Happily Ever After, will be a worthy replacement. One of my wishes recently came true when I got approved to transfer back into merchandise in Frontierland. After my program ended, I went part time at Boardwalk in Private Dining (room service). Private Dining was not my favorite role at Disney and because of that I did not create a post about working at the Boardwalk because I was not sure how to write about it. Merchandise has been my favorite role and Magic Kingdom is my favorite park to work at, so working in Frontierland is a dream come true!",

    "body": "I know I haven't posted anything in a while, but I'm back now. A quick recap of what I didn't post about in the past year. After my college program in Hollywood Hills ended in January 2017, I was offered to work part time at the Boardwalk as a room service cashier/busser. I did not enjoy working there, mainly because the role had low guest interactions. After a few months I transferred to Frontierland merchandise, which I loved. Unfortunately, Frontierland has a candy shop that sells peanut products, which was a problem for me because of my peanut allergy. Since I was unable to work in the candy shop, I had to transfer. My new location was Dinoland attractions, my first time working attractions! Dinoland was a lot of fun and I think attractions is my favorite role at Disney so far. This past January I was offered a full time position and I am now working attractions at the Tomorrowland Speedway.\nIf you have never been to the Tomorrowland Speedway, it is a “race track” that consists of 4 lanes of “race cars” on tracks that reach a top speed of 7 mph. The track itself is about a 5 minute drive. If you were wondering, the cars are 100% gas powered that we fill up every morning before opening. The guests have 100% control of the cars, the only way we can stop cars is by telling the guests to stop, but if they don't listen, there is nothing we can do to stop them.\nOpening Speedway is fairly easy, but takes a while because there are almost 100 cars. Every morning we fill up all of the cars and check the brake fluid and refill as needed. After all the cars are filled up, we start all of them up and drive them from the storage area onto the 4 tracks. The track's guide rails lower before and after the loading platform so we can take the cars on and off the tracks.\nThere are several different positions that you can pick up while working at Speedway.\nWhen you are out at bridge you stand out by the bridge in the back of Speedway, alone for about 45 minutes. You watch all the guests drive by, scanning the entire track, making sure the guests are following the rules, not bumping into the other cars, making sure the cars don't have any problems like stalling, low power to the point were they can't make it up the hill, broken steering, not on fire, not making weird noises. If there is a problem with the car, we put a red checkered flag on the car so we know to cut the car when it gets back to the loading platform. If any younger guests are struggling to drive/reach the pedal, we are able to offer to help them. If they do need our help, we get in the car and drive them the rest of the way back to the loading platform.\nWhen you are a grouper, you assign guests to a car number. Grouper 1/2 groups the guests onto numbers for tracks 1 and 2. Grouper 3/4 groups guests onto numbers for tracks 3 and 4. There are usually 2 guests per car, you can fit 3 guests in a car with younger guests. We try not to split groups up, but it is not always possible/if the guest don't correctly communicate how many are in their party/how many cars they need, we will probably end up having to split them up, but the will be behind the rest of their group in the next set of cars.\nWhen you are on a track, you are either Line 1 or Line 2. On Tracks 1-3, Line 1 is in charge of the first 3 cars on their track. When the guests get in, we make sure they buckle up, then spiel to them telling them not to bump the car in front of them, push down on the pedal to go, lift off the pedal to stop (there is only one pedal, releasing the pedal applies the brakes. Guest often don't understand this, even after we tell them how it works.) After they are buckled and spieled to, they can go. When the next set of cars returns we make sure they stop at the correct number and exit on the same side they got in on. If a car needs to be cut from the track, on a track to the right (will have to cross over your track to get to the storage area) we turn off the first car at the platform and wait for the broken car to be removed. When a car is removed from your track, the line 2 cast member removes the car and you take on the responsibility of Line 1 and Line 2.\nLine 2 is in charge of the last 3 cars on the track. As the cars drive up the the loading platform, we tell the guests which number to stop at. Line 2 is the same as Line 1 spieling to guests and all that. If a car needs to be cut, we let the line 1 CM know that we need to cut the car. If it has broken steering or no power, we get a line 2 CM from a different track to help us. We let our track and the CMs on every track to our left know that we are cutting a car and make sure they stop their first car. Then we lower the tracks needed to get the car off the track after the loading platform and remove it. If it doesn't have steering, we have a jack to pull the car off the track to the service track. If it has low power, we have use a second car to push it off the track. After the car is off, we raise the tracks and let the other CMs know that they are clear to start the cars up again. When we put the car on the service track we write down what is wrong with the car, which track it is from, and how many cars are on the track after we cut the car.\nWhen adding cars, we let our line 1 CM know we are adding cars, stop the guests driving back to the loading platform before the part of the track that lowers, then lower all the tracks before the loading platform. Each car that is being added had a plaque that lets us know which track to add it to, then drive it to that track to the next available spot at the loading platform. After all the cars that are being added are added, we raise the tracks and start the stopped cars back up.\nWorking Track 4 is a bit different because Track 4: track four only has four spots instead of 6 like tracks 1-3. We use track 4 for parties that need help/extra time getting in and out of the cars such as guests in wheelchairs. Line 1 is in charge of cars 1 and 2 and has the same responsibilities as the line 1 on the other tracks. Line 2 is in charge of cars 3 and 4 and has the same responsibilities as the line 2 on the other tracks. When we have a party that needs assistance getting into the cars, we turn off cars 1 and 3 to ensure that the cars aren't going anywhere. We confirm with the party how many cars they need and bring them onto the track from the other side than we normally load guests into the cars. After all of the guests in the party are seated, we turn the cars back on and spiel to them. We put a yellow flag on their cars to let us know when they get back. When they return, we turn off cars 1 and 3 again, have them get out of the car, and exit the same way they entered.\nWe also have merge, Fastpass, and greeter CMs. Greeter CM stands where the standby line and Fastpass lines merge together. They make sure not to overfill the ramps, tell guests which ramp to go to, and send parties that need assistance getting in or out of the cars to Track 4. Fastpass CM stands out front and makes sure everyone entering the Fastpass line has a Fastpass. Greeter CM also stands out front, assisting Fastpass CM, manage the extended queue line, and manage stroller parking.\nClosing Speedway is probably the easiest and most fun to close compared to everywhere else I have worked. We close the tracks one by one throughout the night as the line gets shorter/get closer to closing. When we close a track we put a flag on the last car with guest, then start stacking by moving 6 cars up past the loading area bumper to bumper, one at each spot at the loading platform, then stop the rest behind the loading area bumper to bumper and have the guests exit onto the track and then through the last spot on the loading platform. After the track is closed, we drive the cars off the track back into the storage area. Track 4 has a different closing procedure because it only has 4 spots. Track 4 is the last track to close. After the park closes and we are ready to close track 4, we start cutting the cars from the track while guests are still driving. We do this by always keeping the first car in the line have a cast member in it, and they can't cut the car until the guests in the car behind them gets out and a cast member is in it. Then that cast member waits for a cast member to get in the car behind them, they cut that car, and we repeat until all the cars are cut.\nI am super excited to be full-time in Tomorrowland. Speedway is a lot of fun, all of the cast members there are a blast to work with, I get to watch the fireworks every night, and I will be able to cross-train to the other attractions in Tomorrowland.",
