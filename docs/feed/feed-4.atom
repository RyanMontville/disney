<category term=""/><content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last Thursday I watched the last performance of wishes. Wishes was probably my favorite nighttime show at Disney World and got to watch/listen to Wishes during my first college program at Colombia Harbour House. I will miss Wishes and I hope the new fireworks show, Happily Ever After, will be a worthy replacement. One of my wishes recently came true when I got approved to transfer back into merchandise in Frontierland. After my program ended, I went part time at Boardwalk in Private Dining (room service). Private Dining was not my favorite role at Disney and because of that I did not create a post about working at the Boardwalk because I was not sure how to write about it. Merchandise has been my favorite role and Magic Kingdom is my favorite park to work at, so working in Frontierland is a dream come true!</p>]]><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RyanMontville/disney/refs/heads/main/src/images/2017/05/01.jpg" alt="Wishes"/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RyanMontville/disney/refs/heads/main/src/images/2017/05/02.jpg" alt="Wishes"/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RyanMontville/disney/refs/heads/main/src/images/2017/05/03.jpg" alt="Wishes"/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RyanMontville/disney/refs/heads/main/src/images/2017/05/04.jpg" alt="Wishes"/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RyanMontville/disney/refs/heads/main/src/images/2017/05/05.jpg" alt="Wishes"/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RyanMontville/disney/refs/heads/main/src/images/2017/05/06.jpg" alt="Wishes"/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RyanMontville/disney/refs/heads/main/src/images/2017/05/07.jpg" alt="Wishes"/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RyanMontville/disney/refs/heads/main/src/images/2017/05/08.jpg" alt="Wishes"/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RyanMontville/disney/refs/heads/main/src/images/2017/05/09.jpg" alt="Wishes"/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RyanMontville/disney/refs/heads/main/src/images/2017/05/10.gif" alt="Wishes"/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RyanMontville/disney/refs/heads/main/src/images/2017/05/11.jpg" alt="Wishes"/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RyanMontville/disney/refs/heads/main/src/images/2017/05/12.jpg" alt="Wishes"/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RyanMontville/disney/refs/heads/main/src/images/2017/05/13.jpg" alt="Wishes"/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RyanMontville/disney/refs/heads/main/src/images/2017/05/14.jpg" alt="Wishes"/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RyanMontville/disney/refs/heads/main/src/images/2017/05/15.jpg" alt="Wishes"/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RyanMontville/disney/refs/heads/main/src/images/2017/05/16.jpg" alt="Wishes"/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RyanMontville/disney/refs/heads/main/src/images/2017/05/17.jpg" alt="Wishes"/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RyanMontville/disney/refs/heads/main/src/images/2017/05/18.jpg" alt="Wishes"/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RyanMontville/disney/refs/heads/main/src/images/2017/05/19.jpg" alt="Wishes"/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RyanMontville/disney/refs/heads/main/src/images/2017/05/20.jpg" alt="Wishes"/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RyanMontville/disney/refs/heads/main/src/images/2017/05/21.jpg" alt="Wishes"/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RyanMontville/disney/refs/heads/main/src/images/2017/05/22.jpg" alt="Wishes"/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RyanMontville/disney/refs/heads/main/src/images/2017/05/23.jpg" alt="Wishes"/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RyanMontville/disney/refs/heads/main/src/images/2017/05/24.jpg" alt="Wishes"/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RyanMontville/disney/refs/heads/main/src/images/2017/05/25.jpg" alt="Wishes"/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RyanMontville/disney/refs/heads/main/src/images/2017/05/26.jpg" alt="Wishes"/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RyanMontville/disney/refs/heads/main/src/images/2017/05/27.jpg" alt="Wishes"/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RyanMontville/disney/refs/heads/main/src/images/2017/05/28.jpg" alt="Wishes"/></content>

<category term=""/><content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I know I haven't posted anything in a while, but I'm back now. A quick recap of what I didn't post about in the past year. After my college program in Hollywood Hills ended in January 2017, I was offered to work part time at the Boardwalk as a room service cashier/busser. I did not enjoy working there, mainly because the role had low guest interactions. After a few months I transferred to Frontierland merchandise, which I loved. Unfortunately, Frontierland has a candy shop that sells peanut products, which was a problem for me because of my peanut allergy. Since I was unable to work in the candy shop, I had to transfer. My new location was Dinoland attractions, my first time working attractions! Dinoland was a lot of fun and I think attractions is my favorite role at Disney so far. This past January I was offered a full time position and I am now working attractions at the Tomorrowland Speedway.</p><p>If you have never been to the Tomorrowland Speedway, it is a �race track� that consists of 4 lanes of �race cars� on tracks that reach a top speed of 7 mph. The track itself is about a 5 minute drive. If you were wondering, the cars are 100% gas powered that we fill up every morning before opening. The guests have 100% control of the cars, the only way we can stop cars is by telling the guests to stop, but if they don't listen, there is nothing we can do to stop them.</p><p>Opening Speedway is fairly easy, but takes a while because there are almost 100 cars. Every morning we fill up all of the cars and check the brake fluid and refill as needed. After all the cars are filled up, we start all of them up and drive them from the storage area onto the 4 tracks. The track's guide rails lower before and after the loading platform so we can take the cars on and off the tracks.</p><p>There are several different positions that you can pick up while working at Speedway.</p><p>When you are out at bridge you stand out by the bridge in the back of Speedway, alone for about 45 minutes. You watch all the guests drive by, scanning the entire track, making sure the guests are following the rules, not bumping into the other cars, making sure the cars don't have any problems like stalling, low power to the point were they can't make it up the hill, broken steering, not on fire, not making weird noises. If there is a problem with the car, we put a red checkered flag on the car so we know to cut the car when it gets back to the loading platform. If any younger guests are struggling to drive/reach the pedal, we are able to offer to help them. If they do need our help, we get in the car and drive them the rest of the way back to the loading platform.</p><p>When you are a grouper, you assign guests to a car number. Grouper 1/2 groups the guests onto numbers for tracks 1 and 2. Grouper 3/4 groups guests onto numbers for tracks 3 and 4. There are usually 2 guests per car, you can fit 3 guests in a car with younger guests. We try not to split groups up, but it is not always possible/if the guest don't correctly communicate how many are in their party/how many cars they need, we will probably end up having to split them up, but the will be behind the rest of their group in the next set of cars.</p><p>When you are on a track, you are either Line 1 or Line 2. On Tracks 1-3, Line 1 is in charge of the first 3 cars on their track. When the guests get in, we make sure they buckle up, then spiel to them telling them not to bump the car in front of them, push down on the pedal to go, lift off the pedal to stop (there is only one pedal, releasing the pedal applies the brakes. Guest often don't understand this, even after we tell them how it works.) After they are buckled and spieled to, they can go. When the next set of cars returns we make sure they stop at the correct number and exit on the same side they got in on. If a car needs to be cut from the track, on a track to the right (will have to cross over your track to get to the storage area) we turn off the first car at the platform and wait for the broken car to be removed. When a car is removed from your track, the line 2 cast member removes the car and you take on the responsibility of Line 1 and Line 2.</p><p>Line 2 is in charge of the last 3 cars on the track. As the cars drive up the the loading platform, we tell the guests which number to stop at. Line 2 is the same as Line 1 spieling to guests and all that. If a car needs to be cut, we let the line 1 CM know that we need to cut the car. If it has broken steering or no power, we get a line 2 CM from a different track to help us. We let our track and the CMs on every track to our left know that we are cutting a car and make sure they stop their first car. Then we lower the tracks needed to get the car off the track after the loading platform and remove it. If it doesn't have steering, we have a jack to pull the car off the track to the service track. If it has low power, we have use a second car to push it off the track. After the car is off, we raise the tracks and let the other CMs know that they are clear to start the cars up again. When we put the car on the service track we write down what is wrong with the car, which track it is from, and how many cars are on the track after we cut the car.</p><p>When adding cars, we let our line 1 CM know we are adding cars, stop the guests driving back to the loading platform before the part of the track that lowers, then lower all the tracks before the loading platform. Each car that is being added had a plaque that lets us know which track to add it to, then drive it to that track to the next available spot at the loading platform. After all the cars that are being added are added, we raise the tracks and start the stopped cars back up.</p><p>Working Track 4 is a bit different because Track 4: track four only has four spots instead of 6 like tracks 1-3. We use track 4 for parties that need help/extra time getting in and out of the cars such as guests in wheelchairs. Line 1 is in charge of cars 1 and 2 and has the same responsibilities as the line 1 on the other tracks. Line 2 is in charge of cars 3 and 4 and has the same responsibilities as the line 2 on the other tracks. When we have a party that needs assistance getting into the cars, we turn off cars 1 and 3 to ensure that the cars aren't going anywhere. We confirm with the party how many cars they need and bring them onto the track from the other side than we normally load guests into the cars. After all of the guests in the party are seated, we turn the cars back on and spiel to them. We put a yellow flag on their cars to let us know when they get back. When they return, we turn off cars 1 and 3 again, have them get out of the car, and exit the same way they entered.</p><p>We also have merge, Fastpass, and greeter CMs. Greeter CM stands where the standby line and Fastpass lines merge together. They make sure not to overfill the ramps, tell guests which ramp to go to, and send parties that need assistance getting in or out of the cars to Track 4. Fastpass CM stands out front and makes sure everyone entering the Fastpass line has a Fastpass. Greeter CM also stands out front, assisting Fastpass CM, manage the extended queue line, and manage stroller parking.</p><p>Closing Speedway is probably the easiest and most fun to close compared to everywhere else I have worked. We close the tracks one by one throughout the night as the line gets shorter/get closer to closing. When we close a track we put a flag on the last car with guest, then start stacking by moving 6 cars up past the loading area bumper to bumper, one at each spot at the loading platform, then stop the rest behind the loading area bumper to bumper and have the guests exit onto the track and then through the last spot on the loading platform. After the track is closed, we drive the cars off the track back into the storage area. Track 4 has a different closing procedure because it only has 4 spots. Track 4 is the last track to close. After the park closes and we are ready to close track 4, we start cutting the cars from the track while guests are still driving. We do this by always keeping the first car in the line have a cast member in it, and they can't cut the car until the guests in the car behind them gets out and a cast member is in it. Then that cast member waits for a cast member to get in the car behind them, they cut that car, and we repeat until all the cars are cut.</p><p>I am super excited to be full-time in Tomorrowland. Speedway is a lot of fun, all of the cast members there are a blast to work with, I get to watch the fireworks every night, and I will be able to cross-train to the other attractions in Tomorrowland.</p>]]><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RyanMontville/disney/refs/heads/main/src/images/2018/02/victory-circle.jpg" alt="Group photo at Victory Circle"/></content>

<category term=""/><content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I'm really bad at updating this blog, but is anyone really reading this? I originally created this blog to talk about my DCP. I don't feel like there is enough happening in my life currently to continue to update the blog.</p><p>Since my last post I cross-trained to Space mountain in 2018, then Buzz Lightyear Spaceranger Spin in 2020, then Covid happened. When we reopened, I became miserable working in attractions during a pandemic. In April of 2021 I was able to transfer to Soarin' at Epcot, which I have now work officially at all four parks! Now that Disney has basically dropped all of their pandemic procedures, working for Disney has gotten better.  I like it at Soarin', I am happy working at Epcot and hopefully it only gets better from here. I'm not sure when I will post another update here.</p>]]></content>
